# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Additional Features / Components Added`

#### Error Boundary Component:

This component was added to maintain a smooth user experience by gracefully handling runtime errors that might occur during the application's execution, it displays an error message to inform users that something unexpected happened. This enhances the overall reliability of the application and provides a better user experience.

#### 404 Component:

This Component is displayed when a user navigates to a URL that doesn't correspond to any existing routes or resources within the application.

#### Pagination Component:

To enhance the manageability of the events displayed within the application, I implemented a Pagination feature, to allow viewing the events in smaller, more manageable chunks, improving overall usability.

#### Accessibility:

I also made sure that the colors used meet the accessibility guidelines while also creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience. The colors also pass the AAA conformance levels.

#### Conditional Data Rendering:

To further enhance the user experience, I implemented a feature that avoids rendering data when it's not available.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
